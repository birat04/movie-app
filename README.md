# movie-app
This is a full-stack web application designed for managing movie reviews. It allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and post, update, or delete reviews for movies they have watched. The app integrates a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using the fetch API to interact with the backend) and a backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle review data.
